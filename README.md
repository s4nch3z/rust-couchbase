# rust-couchbase
Couchbase binding for RUST

COMING SOON...

> Note: This project is **incomplete** and the code is of **pre-alpha** quality.

Since RUST announced their first backwards compatible version. I though it would be a great idea to create a binding to something that does not exist. We are currently in the process of creating a low-level binding to libcouchbase library.
High-level binding will come right after.

## Milestone 1
1. ~~Implement low-level connect, get and set to couchbase~~
2. Implement high-level class, connect, get and set
3. Tests for connect, get and set

## Milestone 2
1. Fully implement low-level binding
2. Have a solid plan for a high-level binding

## Milestone 3
1. Fully implement High-level binding
2. Jack and hookers...
